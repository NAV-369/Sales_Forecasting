# Model Serving API

## Task 3 - Model Serving API Call

This project implements a REST API to serve trained machine-learning models for real-time predictions. The API is built using FastAPI and is designed to handle input data, preprocess it, and return predictions.

### Framework

We have chosen **FastAPI** for building the REST API due to its high performance and ease of use.

### Features

- Load serialized machine-learning models for predictions.
- Define API endpoints for prediction requests.
- Handle incoming requests and preprocess input data.
- Return predictions in a structured format.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Sales_Forecasting-main
