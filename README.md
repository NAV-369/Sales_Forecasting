# Task 1 - Exploration of customer purchasing behavior

# Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Sales Forecasting
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior and forecasting sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. By leveraging data-driven insights, the goal is to enhance sales forecasting accuracy, which is crucial for effective inventory management and strategic planning.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes two primary datasets:
- **Training Dataset**: Contains daily sales information for various stores, including features such as sales, customers, promotions, and holidays.
- **Store Dataset**: Provides additional information about each store, including assortment types and competitor distance, which are essential for understanding sales dynamics.

## Project Structure
- **.vscode/**: Contains settings for Visual Studio Code.
- **.github/**: Contains GitHub workflows for continuous integration and deployment, including unit tests.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git to maintain a clean repository.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python packages required for the project, ensuring a consistent development environment.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview and documentation for the project, guiding users through its structure and usage.
- **src/**: Contains source code files for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, showcasing key findings and methodologies.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests to validate the functionality and reliability of the code.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for data processing and other utility functions relevant to the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter notebooks to explore the analyses and visualizations.

## Analysis Overview
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted in this project focuses on understanding customer purchasing behavior through various visualizations and statistical analyses. Key areas of focus include:
- **Distribution of Promotions**: Analyzing how promotions impact sales across different stores.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identifying seasonal purchasing behaviors and their implications for inventory management.
- **Sales Correlation**: Exploring the relationship between sales and customer footfall to inform marketing strategies.
- **Assortment and Competitor Analysis**: Evaluating how assortment types and competitor distance affect sales performance.

## Logging

This project utilizes logging to track the analysis process and ensure traceability. The logs are stored in the `analysis.log` file, which captures key events during the execution of the analysis, including:

- Start and end of the analysis process.
- Successful loading of datasets.
- Merging of data.
- Display of the first few rows of the merged dataset.

### Log File Example

The `analysis.log` file contains entries formatted with timestamps, log levels, and messages. Here is an example of the log entries:

```
